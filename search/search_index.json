Options:   - Universal tenant restrictions in Global Secure Access, which uses policy signaling to tag all traffic, providing both authentication and data plane support on all platforms.   - Authentication plane-only protection, where the corporate proxy sets tenant restrictions v2 signals on all traffic.   - Windows device management, where devices are configured to point Microsoft traffic to the tenant restriction policy, and the policy is enforced in the cloud. Policy enforcement limitation Manage corporate proxies by adding tenants to the Microsoft Entra traffic allowlist. The character limit of the header value in Restrict-Access-To-Tenants:\u00a0<code>&lt;allowed-tenant-list&gt;</code>\u00a0limits the number of tenants that can be added. Managed by a cloud policy in the cross-tenant access policy. A partner policy is created for each external tenant. Currently, the configuration for all external tenants is contained in one policy with a 25KB size limit. Malicious tenant requests Microsoft Entra ID blocks malicious tenant authentication requests to provide authentication plane protection. Microsoft Entra ID blocks malicious tenant authentication requests to provide authentication plane protection. Granularity Limited to tenant and all Microsoft Accounts. Tenant, user, group, and application granularity. (User-level granularity isn't supported with Microsoft Accounts.) Anonymous access Anonymous access to Teams meetings and file sharing is allowed. Anonymous access to Teams meetings is blocked. Access to anonymously shared resources (\u201cAnyone with the link\u201d) is blocked. Microsoft Accounts Uses a Restrict-MSA header to block access to consumer accounts. Allows control of Microsoft Accounts (MSA and Live ID) authentication on both the identity and data planes.   For example, if you enforce tenant restrictions by default, you can create a Microsoft Accounts-specific policy that allows users to access specific apps with their Microsoft Accounts, for example:  Microsoft Learn (app ID\u00a0<code>18fbca16-2224-45f6-85b0-f7bf2b39b3f3</code>), or  Microsoft Enterprise Skills Initiative (app ID\u00a0<code>195e7f27-02f9-4045-9a91-cd2fa1c2af2f</code>). Proxy management Manage corporate proxies by adding tenants to the Microsoft Entra traffic allowlist. For corporate proxy authentication plane protection, configure the proxy to set tenant restrictions v2 signals on all traffic. Platform support Supported on all platforms. Provides only authentication plane protection. Universal tenant restrictions in Global Secure Access support any operating system, browser, or device form factor.   Corporate proxy authentication plane protection supports macOS, Chrome browser, and .NET applications.   Windows device management supports Windows operating systems and Microsoft Edge. Portal support No user interface in the Microsoft Entra admin center for configuring the policy. User interface available in the Microsoft Entra admin center for setting up the cloud policy.

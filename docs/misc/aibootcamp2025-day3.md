## The Art of Crafting Effective Prompts for Your Power Platform AI Tools

### Speaker

- **Elaiza Benitez** – Senior Cloud Advocate, Microsoft
    

**"AI Won’t Replace You, But People Using AI Will."**

### What Makes Generative AI Different?

#### Traditional Rule-Based AI

- Guided by predefined rules.
    
- Rigid and inflexible.
    
- Unable to create new things.
    

#### Generative AI

- Utilizes large, diverse datasets to guide outputs.
    
- Flexible and trainable with provided data.
    
- Capable of creating and producing new content.
    

### The Shift to Generative AI

**Current Apps → Intelligent Apps:**

- **Constrained Interactions → Natural Language Interactions**
    
- **Fixed Data Sets → Data-Driven, Personalized Experiences**
    
- **Costly Changes → Rapid Feature Delivery**
    

### Copilot in Power Apps

- **Formula Drafting**: Describe desired functionality, and Copilot creates the formula for you.
    
- **Error Identification**: Use Copilot to locate and fix errors, improving app quality.
    
- **Formula Explanation**: Gain insights into formulas you didn’t write, with Copilot’s explanations.
    

### Enhancing App End User Experience with Copilot

- **Built-In Copilot Studio**: Customize Copilot for app-specific needs.
    
- **Copilot Controls**: Enable data-focused chat functionalities.
    
- **Rich Text Editing Integration**: Enhance app usability with integrated capabilities.
    

### Unlocking Possibilities

#### Create Automations with Prompts

**"Go from idea to automation using natural language."**

#### Build Functional Websites

**"Effortlessly develop internal portals and customer-facing websites."**

#### Prompt Building with AI Builder

**"Design, test, and embed GenAI prompts across products using a single interface."**

### Prompt Formulas

#### Basic Formula

- **Task → Context → Expectations → Output**
    

**Example**: "Create a product feedback summary based on recent customer reviews. Identify key themes, sentiment, and recurring praises or concerns. Format the summary to be concise and suitable for a marketing team meeting."

#### Expanded Formula

- **Persona → Context → Task → Exemplar → Format → Tone**
    

**Example**: "You are a senior product marketing manager tasked with evaluating feedback on the Contoso Widget. Create a summary based on customer reviews, identifying key themes, overall sentiment, and recurring praises or issues. Use clear and concise language suitable for a marketing meeting. Write in a confident yet friendly tone."

### Prompt Crafting Best Practices

1. **Order Matters**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process prompts sequentially, so the order impacts the response. Test variations for optimal outcomes.
    
2. **Be Mindful of Tokens**:
    
    - AI breaks text into chunks (tokens), encompassing words or parts of words.
        
    - Token limits apply to both input and output, so concise prompts are critical.
        
3. **Beware of Hallucinations**:
    
    - AI may fabricate information when prompts are unclear or overly broad.
        
    - Use specific, fact-based prompts and verify outputs.
        

### Essential Guidelines

1. **Know the Limits**: Copilot is in early stages; understand its constraints.
    
2. **Trial and Error**: Expect prompt revisions for the best results.
    
3. **Copilot ≠ Autopilot**: Craft thoughtful prompts for effective outcomes.
    
4. **Fact-Check Outputs**: Verify AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance.
    

### Power Automate Copilot Formula

- **When → Task → Format**
    

**Example**: "At the end of each week, send me a summary of pending tasks in Planner. Format it as bullet points with task name, status, and due date in a Microsoft Teams message."

### Copilot Studio Topic Formula

- **Task → Context → Expectations**
    

**Example**: "Allow a user to check a flight’s status by entering the flight number and date. Include 2 message variations and a speech option for each question."

### Key Takeaways

1. **Understand the Models**: Each model serves specific purposes, with varying costs.
    
2. **Balance Outcomes**: Balance Generative AI’s creativity and grounded data insights.
    
3. **Educate Prompts**: Link data sources to improve accuracy and relevance.
    
4. **Privacy Assured**: Copilot and agents do not share your data or use it for model training.
    
5. **Access Control**: Copilot only interacts with data you are authorized to access.

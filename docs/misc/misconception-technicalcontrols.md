# The Misconception of Technical Controls in IT Security

---

## **Technical controls alone don’t ensure smarter IT security**

Cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever, yet many organisations in Australia still rely solely on technical controls, leaving critical gaps in their security strategies.  
  
Are you confident your current measures protect every aspect of your organisation? By focusing only on technical controls, you may overlook the critical importance of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), essential components of a comprehensive security strategy.

## **What role do technical controls play in cybersecurity?**

Technical controls—such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems—fall under the “Protect” and “Detect” categories of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.  
  
They’re designed to safeguard systems and identify potential threats, which is crucial in the immediate defence against cyberattacks. However, they form only a part of the big picture in security.

## **The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0**

The NIST CSF 2.0 is an excellent example of an enterprise framework that highlights the broader scope of cybersecurity. It’s organised into six functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. While “Protect” and “Detect” are essential, they represent only a fraction of the overall framework.

- **Govern:** Establishes organisational context and governance structure to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Identify:** Understands organisational resources and cybersecurity risks.
- **Protect:** Implements safeguards to ensure service delivery.
- **Detect:** Identifies when a cybersecurity event occurs.
- **Respond:** Takes action against detected cybersecurity events.
- **Recover:** Restores capabilities or services impaired by cybersecurity events.

## **Why is governance, risk, and compliance so important?**

GRC is the backbone of a holistic security strategy. It ensures your organisation’s IT activities align with your business goals, managing risk effectively and complying with regulations. Neglecting GRC can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, financial losses, legal penalties, and irreparable damage to your organisation’s reputation.

Here’s why GRC is indispensable:

- **Governance:** Sets the tone and strategy, defining policies and procedures that guide your organisation.
- **Risk management:** Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks that could impact your organisation.
- **Compliance:** Ensures adherence to laws, regulations, and standards, reducing the risk of legal penalties and reputational damage.

Understanding these components is essential, but how can organisations effectively implement them?

## **The holistic security picture**

Focusing solely on technical controls is like locking your doors while leaving your windows wide open. To address all aspects of cybersecurity, a comprehensive strategy must integrate GRC—governing your security posture, identifying risks, responding to incidents, and recovering effectively. While technical controls are crucial, they’re just pieces of the puzzle. To build a resilient security strategy, you must include GRC. Incorporating GRC isn’t just best practice—it’s a necessity.

# The Importance of SOAR within a SOC Team

I can’t help but reflect on the critical role that Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) plays within a Security Operations Center (SOC). Having spent countless hours enhancing security postures and managing endpoints, I can understand the immense pressure that a SOC teams face daily. The sheer volume of alerts and the need for rapid response can be overwhelming. This is where SOAR becomes almost a necessity to keep operation running smoothly.

## What is SOAR?

SOAR integrates various security tools and systems, automates repetitive tasks, and manages incident responses. It’s like having an extra set of hands that never tire, ensuring that every alert is addressed promptly and efficiently.

## Why is SOAR Important?

1. **Efficiency and Speed**: Automating routine tasks means we can respond to threats faster. This is crucial in minimizing potential damage.
	
2. **Consistency**: Standardized procedures reduce the risk of human error, ensuring that every incident is handled correctly.
	
3. **Scalability**: As our organization grows, so does the number of security alerts. SOAR helps us manage this without needing to expand our team proportionally.
	
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: A centralized platform improves communication within the SOC team, making our operations more cohesive.

2. **Create Custom Connectors**:
    
    - If a required connector is not available, you can create custom connectors using Azure Logic Apps.
    - Define the triggers and actions for the custom connector.

### Step 4: Monitor and Optimize

1. **Monitor Automation Rules and Playbooks**:
    
    - Regularly monitor the performance of your automation rules and playbooks.
    - Check for any failures or issues and optimize the workflows as needed.
2. **Update and Improve**:
    
    - Continuously update your automation rules and playbooks based on new threats and organizational changes.
    - Leverage community contributions and Microsoft Sentinel’s GitHub repository for new ideas and improvements.

## Examples from the Azure Sentinel GitHub

Looking at the [Azure Sentinel GitHub](https://github.com/Accelerynt-Security/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks) repository, I see practical applications of SOAR, which may help you on your Automation journey. This is by far a small snippet of information, so I would recommend going and checking them out for yourself:

### AS-Azure-AD-Disable-User 

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FPlaybooks%2FAS-Azure-AD-Disable-User%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FPlaybooks%2FAS-Azure-AD-Disable-User%2Fazuredeploy.json)

This playbook is designed to automatically disable a user in Entra ID when a high-severity alert is triggered. For example, if an analytics rule detects suspicious activity from a user account, this playbook can disable the account to prevent further malicious actions. The benefits include immediate containment of potential threats and ensuring that compromised accounts are swiftly neutralized.

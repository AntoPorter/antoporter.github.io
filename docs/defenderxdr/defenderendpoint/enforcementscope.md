# Enforcement Scope - Microsoft Intune Policy Enforcement

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, integrated with Microsoft Intune, offers a comprehensive solution for managing security settings across various platforms, including Windows endpoints, Windows servers, and Linux servers. This report delves into the importance of this integration and how it enhances your security management capabilities.

---
## Key Highlights

1. **Unified Management**: 
   Managing security settings for Windows and Linux devices natively within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ensures a consistent security posture across all your devices. This unified approach simplifies the management process and reduces the risk of security gaps.

2. **Enforcement Scope Configuration**: 
   To enable this feature, navigate to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and go to **Settings > Endpoints > Configuration management > Enforcement scope**. Here, you can enable the option to use Defender for Endpoint to enforce security configuration settings from Intune. This configuration allows for centralized management of security policies, ensuring that all devices adhere to the same security standards.

3. **Synthetic Device Identity**: 
   For devices that aren't fully registered in Microsoft Entra ID, a synthetic device identity is created. This allows the device to retrieve and enforce policies from Intune, ensuring even those devices are protected. This feature is particularly important for managing devices that cannot be fully enrolled in Intune, extending security coverage to a broader range of devices.

4. **Cross-Platform Support**: 
   This setup supports Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server (2012 R2 and up), and Linux. It extends the Microsoft Intune Endpoint Security surface to devices that aren't capable of enrolling in Intune. This cross-platform support is essential for organizations with diverse IT environments, ensuring that all devices, regardless of their operating system, are secured.

## Why This Integration is Important

1. **Enhanced Security Posture**: 
   By integrating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Intune, organizations can ensure that all devices, whether fully enrolled in Intune or not, are protected by consistent security policies. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and enhances the overall security posture of the organization.

2. **Simplified Management**: 
   The unified management approach simplifies the process of configuring and enforcing security policies. IT administrators can manage all devices from a single portal, reducing the complexity and time required to maintain security across the organization.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
   The ability to manage security settings for a wide range of devices, including those not fully registered in Microsoft Entra ID, ensures comprehensive coverage. This is particularly important for organizations with a mix of managed and unmanaged devices, as it ensures that all endpoints are protected.

4. **Scalability**: 
   As organizations grow and their IT environments become more complex, the need for scalable security solutions becomes paramount. The integration of Defender for Endpoint with Intune provides a scalable solution that can adapt to the changing needs of the organization, ensuring that security remains robust and effective.

## Lessons Learned from Deployment and Use

1. **Hybrid Azure AD-Joined Devices**: 
   Ensuring devices are properly Hybrid Azure AD-Joined and Intune enrolled is crucial. This step can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with faulty machines, closed networks, or outdated proxy settings. Using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to trigger hybrid joining and Intune enrollment can streamline this process.

2. **Collaboration with Security Teams**: 
   Working closely with security teams to validate changes, define exception policies, and address specific cases is essential. This collaboration helps in maintaining a brisk pace during deployment and ensures that security policies are effectively implemented.

3. **Handling Non-Compliant Devices**: 
   Identifying and remediating non-compliant devices is a critical part of the deployment process. Using a combination of Intune and Configuration Manager (SCCM) can help manage devices that do not have valid Intune licenses, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment**: 
   Regularly monitoring the deployment and making necessary adjustments based on real-world feedback is important. This includes updating policies, addressing new security threats, and ensuring that all devices remain compliant with the latest security standards.
